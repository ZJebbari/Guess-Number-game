# Guess-Number-game

Welcome to the guessing game! This program was developed using Java and is designed to run on Android devices. While it is not available on the Google Play Store, you can access the code on GitHub and install it on your Android device.

The game begins with a choice of difficulty level. You can choose to guess a number between 0 and 99, 100 and 999, or 1000 and 9999. Once you have made your selection, you will be taken to the next page to begin playing.

You have 10 lives to guess the correct number. The system generates a random number within the range you chose. Your task is to guess the number correctly within the given number of lives.

Each time you make a guess, the system will tell you whether your guess is too high or too low. This feedback will help you narrow down your choices until you eventually guess the correct number.

If you manage to guess the number within 10 lives, you win the game. However, if you use up all your lives without guessing the correct number, you lose the game.

To play the game, download the code from the GitHub repository and install it on your Android device. Launch the application and follow the instructions on the screen to start guessing!
